# Crypto Price Tracker – Full Stack Developer Challenge

## 📋 Objective

This challenge is designed to evaluate your skills as a full stack developer using .NET 6 (C#), Entity Framework Core, Razor Pages, and REST API integration.

You'll be working with a project that simulates tracking cryptocurrency prices using the CoinGecko API.

---

## 🧠 What You Need to Do

### ✅ 1. Fix the Service Logic

- Open `CryptoPriceService.cs` and fix the logic so it correctly:
  - Fetches coin data from CoinGecko for all existing coins  
    Documentation: https://docs.coingecko.com/v3.0.1/reference/introduction
  - Handles async operations properly
  - Prevents duplicate entries
  - Saves the results to the SQLite database

  ⚠️ If you encounter duplicate entries or errors from the CoinGecko API, decide how to handle them.  
  You're free to choose the best approach — just make sure you explain your reasoning in a short code comment.

  ⚠️ Some files may have outdated or incorrect `namespace` declarations. Please review and update them as needed to ensure consistency across the project.

### ✅ 2. Complete the Controller

- Open `CryptoController.cs` and:
  - Complete the `POST /api/crypto/update-prices` endpoint
  - Add a `GET /api/crypto/latest-prices` endpoint to return the most recent price per asset. All available cryptocoins must be saved.

### ✅ 3. Test the Razor Frontend

- The view in `/Views/Home/Index.cshtml` includes a button to call the API.
- Ensure that the interface provides clear feedback to the user indicating whether the update succeeded or failed.

### ✅ 4. Create the Frontend Visualization in `Index.cshtml`

Build a clean and user-friendly visualization directly in the existing Razor view:  
**`/Views/Home/Index.cshtml`**

This page must:

- Display **each cryptocurrency asset** with at least the following fields:
  - ✅ **Name**
  - ✅ **Symbol**
  - ✅ **Current Price**
  - ✅ **Currency**
  - ✅ **Icon**
    - Add the `IconUrl` property to the `CryptoAsset` model
    - Retrieve the image url from CoinGecko
    - Save it to the database
  - ✅ **Last Updated**
    - This value must be converted to the client's local timezone using JavaScript
  - ✅ **Trend**
    - Add a visual indicator showing whether the price has increased, decreased, or stayed the same compared to the previous saved price (e.g., 🔼, 🔽, ➖)
    - Optionally, include the percentage change

- Use the existing "Update Prices" button to trigger the API and refresh the data displayed in the view.

> 🎯 **Goal:** The user should be able to open the page, see the most recent cryptocurrency data clearly presented, and update it with one click.

> 💡 Bonus points for improved UI, animations, or anything that enhances clarity and usability.

### ✅ 5. Add Improvements

- Add validation logic or error handling where needed
- Create unit tests for validator or service logic

## ⚙️ How to Run the Project

1. Make sure you have **.NET 6 SDK** installed.
2. Navigate to the backend project folder:
   ```bash
   cd Backend/CryptoPriceTracker.Api
   ```
3. Restore dependencies:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```
4. Generate your own migrations and update the database:
   ```bash
   dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
   dotnet ef database update
   ```
5. Run the project:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```
6. Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to test the Razor page.

---

## 🧪 Testing

You may add unit tests to demonstrate how you validate business logic (e.g., in the `PriceValidator` class).

---

## 💬 Assumptions and Decisions

✏️ If you made any assumptions due to missing or unclear requirements, please **leave a brief comment** in the code explaining what you assumed and why.

---

## 🧠 Optional Architecture Upgrade

💡 You may reorganize the project structure or apply your preferred architecture (e.g., Clean Architecture, layered services, etc.)  
as long as:

- The functionality remains the same  
- The Razor page and API endpoints still work as requested  
- You document your reasoning in code comments or a note in the README

---

## 📝 Notes

- 🔸 **Do not include generated migrations or database files in your submission.**
- The project uses SQLite via EF Core for simplicity.
- CoinGecko API is public and doesn't require authentication for basic price lookups.
- The crypto icon should be retrieved from the CoinGecko API.
